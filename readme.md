<h1 align="center">Post Not Found for Elementor Pro</h3>
  <p align="center">
    This plugin solves a single simple ommision in elementor pro. When there are no posts found for an elementor pro's posts widget, we should display something to say just that: there were no posts found. <br>This plugin adds controls to the elementor page builder that makes it easy to include a saved section or just display some simple text indicating no posts were found.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

I used this issue to show how I build simple wordpress plugins. If you are interested in watching me build this from scratch check out the youtube video here:

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Just like any wordpress plugin, if installing from this repo, download the zip file & upload to the wordpress admin dashboard.

### Prerequisites

This plugin requires the paid Elementor Pro subscription to be of any use

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Open the elementor page builder and insert a post widget.
Then in the content tab, under query toggle the show not found content.

Use the drop down to choose if you would prefer to show a simple text message or a saved elementor section.
(you will need to save the section prior to using it here.)<br><br>
